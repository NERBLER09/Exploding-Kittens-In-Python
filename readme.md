# Exploding Kittens Recreated In Python
---
## Overview Of Project
This is a fan project of Exploding Kittens recreated in Python Tkinter.

Anyone wanting to use the source code to use it to create there own project,
fill free to clone it, but it would be appreciate if you gave credit

## Setting Up The Code For Use In Your Own Project 
- If you don't have [Python](https://www.python.org) installed first install that, for the project I used [Python 3.8.5](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-385/) 
- Clone the project using `git clone https://github.com/NERBLER09/Exploding-Kittens-In-Python`
- Open up you preferred editor, I used [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- Run `python Title_Screen_REWRITE.py` to run 

## Versions
Currently there are 7 releases of Exploding Kittens In Python available for download.

You can download all versions for Windows. For now you can't download Exploding Kittens In Python for linux, but 
a Snapcraft download will be available soon. A MacOS download wont be available.
 
## Is The Setup File Safe To Download?
If you are downloading anyone on the setup files on a Chromium based browser, Chrome, Firefox or IE(Internet Explorer) it reports the setup file as dangerous. The setup file you downloaded is not malicious and is safe to run on your own system

If it was unsafe I would be trying to hide the file in layers of folders, but all the files are on the top level. 

The issue will be resolve by the next release!
